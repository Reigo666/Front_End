                CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users —
                how they are styled, laid out, etc A document is usually a text file
                structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup
                language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG
                or XML. Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form
                usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are
                designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen,
                projector or printer.

                CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example
                changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to
                create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout
                with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can
                even be used for effects such as animation

                Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is
                key to being able to create layouts with CSS, or to align items with other
                items. In this lesson, we will take a proper look at the CSS Box Model so
                that you can build more complex layout tasks with an understanding of how
                it works and the terminology that relates to it.

                <ul>
                <li>The box will break onto a new line.</li>
                <li>
                    The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available
                    in its container. In most cases this means that the box will become as
                    wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.
                </li>
                <li>The width and height properties are respected.</li>
                <li>
                    Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away
                    from the box

                The border-radius CSS property rounds the corners of an element's outer
                border edge. You can set a single radius to make circular corners, or two
                radii to make elliptical corners.
